	\\ 
    Dear Professor Collins,\\ 
    \\
    Prepared for my \Term work term at \textbf{\textsl{\Company}}, my third and final work term report is
	entitled \textbf{\textsl{WKRPT400: \ReportTitle}}. The objective of this work term report is to perform an in depth structural analysis on the current aerostat winch system.\\ 
	\\
	\Company  has one simple mission, to deliver telecommunication in remote areas with increased reliability and more cost effectively. Another major selling point is full autonomy led by state of the art controls.\\
	\\
	As a systems engineering intern under the supervision of Ephraim Lanford, I was primarily responsible for conducting advanced analyses on the aerostat's tether management system.\\ 
	\\
	This report was written entirely by me and has not received any previous academic credit at this or
	any other institution. I would like to thank Ephraim Lanford and John Umina for their expertise of pressure vessels design and knowledge of ASME's BPVC. No other sources of aid were used for this report.\\ 
	\\
	Best Regards,\\
	\\
	\Seb\\
