    Dear Professor Collins,\\ \\
	\noindent
    Prepared for my \Term work term at \textbf{\textsl{\Company}}, my third and final work term report is
	entitled \textbf{\textsl{\ReportTitle}}. The objective of this work term report was to perform an in depth structural analysis on the current aerostat's winch system.\\ \\
	\noindent	
	\Company  has one simple mission, to deliver telecommunication in remote areas with increased reliability and more cost effectively. Another major selling point is fully autonomy led by state of the art controls.\\\\
	\noindent
	As a systems engineering intern under the supervision of Ephraim Lanford, I was primarily responsible for conducting advanced analyses on the aerostat's tether management system.\\ \\
	\noindent
	This report was written entirely by me and has not received any previous academic credit at this or
	any other institution. I would like to thank Ephraim Lanford for all guidance. Also, John Umina for his expertise in the design of pressure vessels. No other sources of aid were used for this report.\\ \\
	\noindent
	Best Regards,\\
	\\

	\Seb\\
