As a result of Altaeros' decision to manufacture the grounded tether management's winch system in house, a complete structural analysis is required to be completed. First, the derivation of the Capstan equation was explored to understand how tether tension of $T=11,525 \Unit{lbs} = 51,264\Unit{N}$ translates to external pressure. From this, a pressure of $p=1376\Unit{psi}= 9.486\Unit{MPa}$ was calculated. From this, existing codes and standards were studied to find an initial benchmark. Upon studying ASME's BPVC, EN, DNV and TWPV a range of thicknesses $t\in [0.825, 1.680]$ (inch) were calculated. \\

The governing ODE for thin shell theory was presented and from this, an in depth analysis was completed. Assuming a fixed end cylinder loaded with uniform pressure $p$ returned a thickness of 1.686 in / 42.8 mm matching ASME BPVC VIII-1 calculations. Further buckling analysis was completed to explore other failure modes. Setting the critical buckling pressure to $p'=p$ yielded a critical thickness  of 0.418 in / 10.6 mm, confirming that buckling is not the primary mode of failure.\\

A series of ANSYS FEA runs were completed to understand the equivalent stresses. Run 1 explored uniform pressure $p$ with both fixed and simply supported ends yielding required thicknesses of 1.200 and 0.875 in respectively. Run 2 focused on modeling the exponential decay as per Capstan equation. with simply supported ends yielding a $t=0.550\Unit{in}$. Run 3 focused on a linear eigenvalue buckling analysis to confirm analytical findings. A critical thickness of approximately 0.400 in, converging with preliminary calculations. Run 4 served as a preliminary benchmark for flange design. It was determined that the optimal flange thickness is 0.250 in.\\

In short, based on a tabular summary of all report findings, it was concluded that the winch drum should be manufactured from a Schedule 30 ($t=$ 0.625 in), 28 in OD pipe. Numerical error, material imperfections and non linear buckling were discussed.
