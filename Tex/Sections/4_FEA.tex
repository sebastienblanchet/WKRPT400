In this section, the results from previous sections will be compared with those in an ANSYS Mechanical finite element analysis (FEA).

\section{Model}

Using the parameters from Table~\ref{table:prelim_params} , the drum geometry was modeled as a thin surface to save computational cost and time. The geometry and coordinate system adopted in this foregoing analysis are shown below in Figure~\ref{fig:4_geom}.

\end{figure}

In this model, the drum's thin surface has a parameterized inward thickness. This variable will be explored to determine how the maximum stress in the drum varies.


\section{Run 2}

The second run continues on the results determined from Run 1.

\subsection{Boundary Conditions}

Both of the drum's ends are simply supported (i.e. BCs as per \ref{eq:2_endBC} ). In other words, simple supports carry no end moments.

Figure~\ref{fig:4_R2_tens} shows the location of applied tether tension of $11,525\ lbs.$ or $51,264\ N$.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:4_R2_pvar} shows the variable Capstan pressure applied as per results from \ref{subsection:alt} (see Figure~\ref{fig:4_R2_pvarplot} for $p(z)$ ). Note again that the boundary conditions are for $\mu=0.05$ , which is essentially the worst case scenario.
