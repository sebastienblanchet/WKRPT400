\section{Considerations}
Assumptions of thin walled\\

Material imperfections resulting in higher stress concentrations\\

Linear buckling\\
imperfections and nonlinearities prevent most real-world structures from achieving their theoretical elastic buckling strength\\


\section{Manufacturing}

It must be accounted for that this will have to manufactured with standard available ASME pipe. See Table~\ref{table:5_pipe} for standard pipe available as per \cite{PIPEINFO}. Note that all dimensions are shown in USC as per standard pipe.
