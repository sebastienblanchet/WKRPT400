Based on the analysis completed in this report, there are several recommendations that should be made to yield more accurate and realistic results. First, as for boundary conditions, more work should be completed on what the flanges could be modeled as to ensure complete accuracy in calculations, especially in FEA. The initial results found in this report serve as a great benchmark. The design should be iterated upon.\\

In terms of buckling, it was mentioned that the linear analysis yields highly unconservative results relative to those attained from a non linear set up. This being said, to further verify and assure that buckling will not be primary mode of failure, a non linear analysis should be completed.\\

Furthermore, due to the cyclic nature of the changing aerostat tether loads, it would also be important to perform a fatigue analysis. This should only be investigated however when the project reaches the commercial phase and the system will require to be functional for years at a time. This was not done in this report as this proposed drum assembly is set to be for testing purposes.\\

Finally, to assure that results attained are in fact safe, a series of proof testing should be completed on the final drum assembly to assure that the system is capable of withstanding loads. This would be the final step ensure that the suggested sizing is indeed safe for the products entire lifespan.\\
