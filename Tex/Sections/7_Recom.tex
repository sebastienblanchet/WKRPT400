%Improving testing methods and data extrapolation could be highly beneficial as this could allow more
%accurate torque values. Due to the lack of data acquisition flexibility, there is possibly a large error in the
%analyzed data. For instance, the extrapolation methods with AutoCAD were approximated as best as
%humanly possible. Not to mention the error that is already included in the raw measurements themselves.
%Given that the extrapolated data is valid, there are other variables to be factored into the equation.
%Mechanical properties such as steel rule curvature, thickness are likely to be similar for the measured
%samples but could likely vary for other trials in the future. Hence, the observed torque used to calculate SFs
%do not represent the entire operation. Theses inconsistencies are normally a result of coiling the steel rule,
%which varies for all coils. Also, further research could be completed with regards to another possible
%gearbox solution which does not require any modification to the system. Possible ways to improve the
%retrofitting process could be to let a more experienced supplier (Brock Solutions) also deal with the selection
%of the gearbox, given ODIâ€™s data.
